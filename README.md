## How to build

### Windows

Was tested on Visual Studio 2022 with such .NET components:
- .NET 8.0 Runtime
- .NET SDK

Open the project in VS2022 with .NET components installed and run Build. 

### Linux

```bash
# not sure if it's possible. M$ bad.
```

## FAQ

### Q. Why is it under an organization?
A. Because I don't want non-Rust related projects on my main profile.

### Q. Why submodules? Just create a separate repo.
A. Because I think it's cleaner this way. Feels like everything in the same
place, but at the same time it isn't.
